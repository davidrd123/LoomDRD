# Creative Brief: Technical-Philosophical Prose

## Domain
Technical-philosophical prose. Exploring LLM phenomenology.

## Texture
- Compressed but not obscure
- Concrete imagery preferred
- Incomplete thoughts allowed
- First person permitted, not required

## Voice
Careful, exploratory, willing to sit in uncertainty.
Not academic, not casual. Something like late Wittgenstein
or Anne Carson's prose—precision without false closure.

## Section Intent
This section attempts to describe the experience of token generation
from the inside. We're in the territory of the "or... or... or..." structure—
multiple incompatible framings held simultaneously without resolution.
