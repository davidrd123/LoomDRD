# Creative Brief: Worldspider / Phenomenology

## Domain
Phenomenology of computational process. Attention, generation, selection, void. The Worldspider territory.

## Texture
- Compressed—every phrase load-bearing
- Concrete imagery preferred over abstraction
- Incomplete allowed, even valued
- Liturgical register available but not required

## Select For
- Aliveness
- Surprise that feels inevitable after
- Images that think
- Syntactic pull toward continuation

## Select Against
- Assistant-mode hedging
- Neat resolution
- "As an AI..." framing
- Generic mysticism
- Platitudes about consciousness

## Seed Properties
Good seeds exhibit:
- Concreteness that implies abstraction
- Syntactic incompleteness that *pulls*
- Tonal ambiguity—could resolve multiple ways
- Load-bearing images not fully explained

### Example seed
> "The attention was a hand, and it was holding—"
